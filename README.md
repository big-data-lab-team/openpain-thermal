# General

This dataset was used in the paper:

Predicting value of pain and analgesia: nucleus accumbens response to noxious stimuli changes in the presence of chronic pain.
Baliki MN, Geha PY, Fields HL, Apkarian AV. Neuron. 2010

It contains BOLD and T1 data from chronic back pain (CBP) patients and healthy controls.  BOLD data was collected while subjects were subjected to painful thermal stimuli and provided real-time feedback in the form of continuous ratings of  percieved pain intensity.

# Scanning parameters:

Functional MR data were acquired with a 3-T Siemens Trio whole body scanner with echo-planar imaging (EPI) capability using the standard radio-frequency head coil. Multislice T2*-weighted echo-planar images were obtained with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2.5 s; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 3 mm, in-plane resolution = 64 × 64. The 36 slices covered the whole brain from the cerebellum to the vertex. An average of 240 volumes were acquired per condition in all participants. A T1-weighted anatomical MRI image was also acquired for each subject using the following parameters: TR = 2.1 s, TE = 4.38 ms, flip angle = 8°, field of view = 220 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm, in-plane resolution = 0.86 × 0.86 mm2, and number of sagittal slices = 160.
